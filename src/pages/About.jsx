            Hi again, I'm Manav ✌🏻 — a mountain soul 🏔️, photographer at heart
            📸, and someone who believes in the power of transformation 💪🏻.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-100">
            My whole life, I had been eating crap, consuming crap — physically
            and mentally.But something changed two years ago. I hit a point
            where I realized I had to take responsibility for my health, my
            mindset, and my energy. That shift led me to clean eating, fitness,
            and falling in love with the gym. What started as a decision became
            a way of life — one grounded in discipline, strength, and
            self-respect.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-100">
            Through all of life's ups and downs, one thing has remained
            constant: my love for mountains and photography. Nature has always
            been my escape, my reset button. The mountains teach me patience,
            presence, and perspective. Photography helps me slow down, observe,
            and tell stories without saying a word.
          </p>

            Thanks for being here. Let's keep exploring — through the lens,
            through the journey.
